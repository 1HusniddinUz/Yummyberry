  mainTop1P: `Cultivated strawberries began to be grown in Uzbekistan in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
    In 1895–96, the governor of Tashkent brought strawberry seedlings from Russia and planted
    them in his country estate. When the berries ripened and turned a beautiful red color,
    gardeners began to ask what they were called. This is how this fruit entered our language,
    evolving from the Russian word "klubnika" into "qulupnay." In fact, strawberries are not
    true berries. The delicious red fruits are actually receptacles, while the plant’s
    "real fruits" are the tiny seeds covering the surface of a ripe strawberry.`,

Among the vast diversity of strawberry varieties, Seol-Hyang stands out due to several key qualities:
📌High density – the berries have a firm, meaty texture, which is highly appreciated by strawberry lovers.
📌 Rich flavor – when you serve large, beautiful strawberries, it is essential that their taste matches their appearance.
📌 Natural sweetness – even slightly unripe berries contain a high amount of fructose, while a perfectly ripe harvest is nothing short of natural fruit honey.
#CompanyName – choosing the best for your family!`,
